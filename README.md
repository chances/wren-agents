Agent-based modeling (ABM) framework for [Wren](https://wren.io) applications.

An agent-based (or individual-based) model is a computational simulation of autonomous agents that react to their
environment (including other agents) given a predefined set of rules ^[[1](http://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2006.04.023)]^. Many real-world emergent behaviors given simple agent interactions can only be captured in an
agent-based model.
