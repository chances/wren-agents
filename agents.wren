/// Agent-based modeling (ABM) framework for Wren applications.

/// An agent-based (or individual-based) model is a computational simulation of autonomous agents that react to their environment (including other agents) given a predefined set of rules <sup>[[1](http://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2006.04.023)]</sup>.
/// Many real-world emergent behaviors given simple agent interactions can only be captured in an agent-based model.
